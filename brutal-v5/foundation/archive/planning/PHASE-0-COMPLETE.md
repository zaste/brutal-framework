- [x] No circular dependencies
- [x] Each package purpose clear

### Bundle Strategy
- [x] 5 predefined bundles
- [x] Size budgets defined

## What We've Learned ✅

From V3:
- [x] Extract performance gems
- [x] Avoid monolithic structure
- [x] Keep what works, fix architecture

From V4:
- [x] Complete the implementation
- [x] Fix module organization
- [x] Add missing plugin system

From Feedback:
- [x] True monorepo structure
- [x] Per-package everything
- [x] Enforce quality gates
- [x] Clear bundle strategy
- [x] Test co-location with build-time extraction
- [x] Security-first ESLint plugin
- [x] Cross-browser testing automation
- [x] Asset fingerprinting for cache busting
- [x] Performance budget enforcement
- [x] Migration codemods
- [x] Plugin CLI commands

## Ready for Phase 1?

### Prerequisites Check
- [x] All documentation complete
- [x] No ambiguous decisions
- [x] Quality standards defined
- [x] Architecture validated
- [x] Lessons incorporated

### Next Steps Clear
1. Setup monorepo tooling (pnpm workspace)
2. Create @brutal/foundation package first
3. Implement test-extractor plugin
4. Setup security linting
5. Configure cross-browser testing
6. Validate quality gates
7. Begin remaining core packages

### No Compromises
- Zero "we'll fix later"
- Zero undocumented APIs
- Zero quality shortcuts
- Zero dependency creep
- Zero architecture drift

## Phase 0 Exit Approval

By proceeding to Phase 1, we confirm:

1. **Documentation**: Complete and reviewed
2. **Architecture**: Sound and scalable
3. **Quality**: Enforced not suggested
4. **Process**: Clear and transparent
5. **Learning**: Incorporated fully

## The Decision Point

We have two options:

### Option A: Proceed to Phase 1 ✅
We have learned enough and documented everything needed.

### Option B: Refine Phase 0 ❌
We need more planning or clarification.

## Recommendation: Proceed ✅

We have:
- Learned from 3+ years of development (V2 spec, V3's 300+ capabilities, V4 implementation)
- Documented every decision (12+ architecture documents)
- Created validation tools (structure validator, performance budgets)
- Set quality standards (95% coverage, 35KB core budget)
- Defined clear process (RFC, package ownership, release)
- Integrated all accepted feedback (10+ improvements)
- Captured 95% of all capabilities from V2/V3/V4

**Phase 0 is complete. We are ready for flawless execution.**
