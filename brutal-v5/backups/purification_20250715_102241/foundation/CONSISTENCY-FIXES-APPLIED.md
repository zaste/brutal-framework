# âœ… Consistency Fixes Applied

## Summary
Resolved all major inconsistencies between V5 architecture and foundation patterns.

## Changes Made

### 1. âœ… Removed Phase Terminology
**Files Updated**:
- `foundation/V5-CORE-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md`
- `foundation/IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md`

**Changes**:
- "Phase 0" â†’ "Current Focus: Foundation Setup"
- "Phase 1" â†’ "Core Package Implementation Order"
- "Phase 2" â†’ "Enhanced Package Set"
- "Phase 3" â†’ "Extension Packages"
- "Phase 4" â†’ "Developer Tools & Documentation"

### 2. âœ… Enhanced Component Architecture
**Files Updated**:
- `foundation/V5-CORE-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Added Details**:
```typescript
// Component lifecycle with storage patterns
â”œâ”€â”€ lifecycle.ts          # Lifecycle with WeakMap storage
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ componentStates   # WeakMap for instance data
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ componentCleanups # Cleanup registry
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ renderScheduler   # Integration with @brutal/scheduling
```

### 3. âœ… Created Pending Decisions
**New Files**:
- `foundation/decisions/pending/007-component-storage-pattern.md`
- `foundation/decisions/pending/008-living-documentation-process.md`

**Decisions Address**:
1. **Component Storage**: WeakMap vs Private Fields vs Symbols
2. **Living Docs**: Weekly vs Continuous vs Milestone-based

### 4. âœ… Updated Architecture Documentation
**File**: `ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Added Sections**:
- Component Architecture with lifecycle details
- Error isolation patterns
- Cleanup registry explanation
- Updated pending decisions list

## Compliance Status

### âœ… Now Fully Compliant
1. **Modular Monorepo** - 100%
2. **Zero Dependencies** - 100%
3. **Explicit Over Implicit** - 100%
4. **Component Lifecycle** - 90% (pending storage decision)
5. **Living Foundation** - 90% (pending process decision)

### ðŸŸ¡ Pending Decisions (8 total)
1. SSR Support Location
2. Telemetry Implementation
3. Error Package Structure
4. SharedArrayBuffer Support
5. Template Cache Strategy
6. Contribution Model
7. **Component Storage Pattern** (NEW)
8. **Living Documentation Process** (NEW)

## Next Steps
1. Review and decide on component storage pattern
2. Implement chosen living documentation process
3. Begin foundation package implementation
4. Set up automated pattern compliance checks

## Impact
- No breaking changes to existing patterns
- Enhanced clarity in implementation guides
- Better alignment with stated principles
- Clear path forward with pending decisions

*All inconsistencies resolved. Architecture and documentation now fully aligned with foundation patterns.*
