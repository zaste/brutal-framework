# ðŸ“š Foundation Documentation

## Design Process

The `design-process/` directory contains the historical analysis and decisions that led to the current foundation design:

- **FOUNDATION-DESIGN.md** - Initial design proposal
- **OPTIONS-COMPARISON.md** - Comparison of 3 architecture options
- **FOUNDATION-DECISIONS-ANALYSIS.md** - Deep analysis of each option
- **V5-VALUE-EXTRACTION.md** - Lessons learned from V5
- **FINAL-DECISION-FOUNDATION.md** - Final architecture decision

These documents are preserved for historical context but are NOT active documentation. For current usage, see the main [README.md](../README.md).
