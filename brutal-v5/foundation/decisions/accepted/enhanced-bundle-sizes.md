# Decision: Enhanced Bundle Sizes Adjustment

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2025-07-13

## Context

Initial bundle size specifications for enhanced packages were too optimistic based on V3 experience. After implementing all features for enhanced packages, actual sizes exceed original estimates.

## Decision

Maintain AMBITIOUS bundle sizes that challenge implementation:

- @brutal/enhanced-state: 8KB (forces real optimization)
- @brutal/enhanced-components: 10KB (demands innovation)
- @brutal/enhanced-routing: 7KB (requires excellence)

Total enhanced bundle: 25KB (aggressive target)
Total with core: 60KB (beats competition)

## Rationale

The original sizes were based on V3's simpler implementations. V5 enhanced packages include:

### enhanced-state (12KB)
- Time-travel debugging with full history
- Multiple persistence adapters
- Computed properties with dependency tracking
- DevTools integration
- Middleware pipeline system

### enhanced-components (12KB)
- Async component loading
- Portal system for rendering outside DOM
- Observer components with intersection observer
- Advanced lifecycle management

### enhanced-routing (10KB)
- Route guards with async support
- Route transitions with multiple modes
- Nested routing support
- Lazy route loading
- Navigation controller
- Route metadata management

## Consequences

- Still lightweight compared to alternatives
- No feature compromises
- Maintains 100% functionality
- 5KB increase is negligible for enhanced features
- Aligns with "no premature optimization" principle

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Aggressive optimization**: Would sacrifice features and future scalability
2. **Code splitting**: Adds complexity for minimal gains
3. **Feature reduction**: Goes against 100% completion goal
