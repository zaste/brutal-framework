# Decision: Living Documentation Process

## Status
ðŸŸ¡ PENDING

## Context
Our foundation patterns advocate for "living documentation" that evolves continuously, but we need a concrete process to ensure this happens systematically.

## Problem
How do we implement a living documentation process that ensures:
- Documentation stays current
- Knowledge is continuously extracted
- Patterns evolve with implementation
- No stale documentation

## Options

### Option 1: Weekly Review Cycle
```yaml
schedule:
  - Monday: Review implementation progress
  - Wednesday: Extract new patterns
  - Friday: Update documentation
  
tracking:
  - FRESHNESS.md with last-updated dates
  - Automated staleness detection
  - Review assignments
```

**Pros**:
- Regular cadence
- Clear responsibilities
- Predictable updates
- Easy to track

**Cons**:
- Requires dedicated time
- May feel like overhead
- Could become checkbox exercise

### Option 2: Continuous Integration
```yaml
triggers:
  - On every PR that changes code
  - Automated pattern extraction
  - Documentation CI checks
  
automation:
  - Extract JSDoc to patterns
  - Check documentation references
  - Flag outdated examples
```

**Pros**:
- Always current
- No manual overhead
- Integrated with development
- Immediate feedback

**Cons**:
- Complex tooling required
- May slow down PRs
- Harder to extract insights

### Option 3: Milestone-Based Updates
```yaml
updates:
  - After each package completion
  - Before major releases
  - When patterns emerge
  
process:
  - Retrospective analysis
  - Pattern extraction session
  - Documentation sprint
```

**Pros**:
- Natural checkpoints
- Focused effort
- Deeper analysis
- Less frequent overhead

**Cons**:
- Can lag behind code
- Batch updates harder
- Knowledge may be lost

## Constraints
- Must not significantly slow development
- Must capture emerging patterns
- Must track document freshness
- Must integrate with existing workflow

## Trade-offs
- **Frequency vs Depth**: More frequent = shallower, less frequent = deeper
- **Automation vs Insight**: Automated = consistent, manual = insightful
- **Integration vs Separation**: Integrated = current, separated = focused

## Recommendation
TBD - Hybrid approach may be best:
1. Automated checks for references and examples
2. Weekly quick review for freshness
3. Milestone deep-dive for pattern extraction

## Implementation Requirements

### For Any Option
```markdown
foundation/
â”œâ”€â”€ FRESHNESS.md          # Document status tracking
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ check-docs.js     # Validate references
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ extract-patterns.js # Find new patterns
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ update-freshness.js # Update timestamps
â””â”€â”€ .github/
    â””â”€â”€ workflows/
        â””â”€â”€ docs-check.yml # CI integration
```

### Tracking Metrics
- Documents updated per week
- Average document age
- Pattern extraction rate
- Dead reference count

## Questions for Team
1. How much time can we allocate to documentation?
2. Should documentation updates block PRs?
3. Who owns documentation freshness?
4. What tools can we build/buy?

## Impact
- Affects all contributors
- Influences documentation quality
- Impacts knowledge retention
- Sets cultural precedent

## Decision Deadline
Before first major package release
