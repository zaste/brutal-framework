# V5 Pattern Extraction Summary

## What We've Extracted from V5 Documentation

### Core Architectural Patterns
1. **[Modular Monorepo](./architecture/modular-monorepo.md)**
   - True package independence
   - Explicit dependency graph
   - No circular dependencies
   - Shared tooling only

2. **[Bundle Composition](./architecture/bundle-composition.md)**
   - 5 predefined bundles (lite/core/enhanced/ui/full)
   - Explicit package lists
   - Custom bundle support
   - Size budget enforcement

### Quality Patterns
1. **[Automated Quality Gates](./quality/automated-quality-gates.md)**
   - Multi-stage enforcement
   - No manual overrides
   - Fast feedback loops
   - Metrics-driven

### Governance Patterns
1. **[Living Documentation](./governance/living-documentation.md)**
   - Continuous evolution
   - No "phase complete"
   - Feedback loops
   - Knowledge compounds

### Core Principles Extracted
1. **[Zero Dependencies](../principles/zero-dependencies.md)**
   - No runtime dependencies ever
   - Build everything needed
   - Security and control

2. **[Modular Architecture](../principles/modular-architecture.md)**
   - Small, focused packages
   - Composition over inheritance
   - Pay for what you use

3. **[Automation Over Discipline](../principles/automation-over-discipline.md)**
   - Enforce through tooling
   - No reliance on human discipline
   - Quality gates automated

4. **[Explicit Over Implicit](../principles/explicit-over-implicit.md)**
   - No magic or hidden behavior
   - Clear dependencies
   - Self-documenting code

## Key Insights from V5 Thinking

### 1. Evolution from V3/V4
- **V3 Problem**: Monolithic structure (800KB+)
- **V4 Problem**: Good architecture but incomplete
- **V5 Solution**: Complete planning before coding

### 2. Non-Negotiable Standards
- 95% test coverage (enforced)
- Zero runtime dependencies (no exceptions)
- Performance budgets (build fails if exceeded)
- TypeScript strict mode (required)

### 3. Bundle Strategy Evolution
- Not one-size-fits-all
- Explicit composition
- Progressive enhancement
- Tree-shaking friendly

### 4. Continuous Improvement Model
- Documentation evolves with code
- Decisions can be superseded
- Patterns version over time
- Learning feeds back to principles

## What Makes V5 Different

### From Traditional Frameworks
1. **No External Dependencies** - Not even one
2. **True Modularity** - Actually independent packages
3. **Enforced Quality** - Not suggested, required
4. **Living Foundation** - Not frozen phases

### From Previous Versions
1. **Complete Planning** - All decisions documented
2. **Proven Patterns** - Extracted from V3/V4 success
3. **Automated Everything** - Quality through tooling
4. **Explicit Always** - No magic, no surprises

## Remaining V5 Patterns to Document

### Decision Patterns
- [ ] RFC process for changes
- [ ] Decision flow lifecycle
- [ ] Community input integration

### Performance Patterns  
- [ ] Performance budget enforcement
- [ ] Size checking automation
- [ ] Bundle optimization

### Development Patterns
- [ ] Test co-location with stripping
- [ ] Security-first ESLint rules
- [ ] Cross-browser testing matrix

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Extracted core V5 patterns
2. ⏳ Extract V4 implementation patterns
3. ⏳ Extract V3 performance gems
4. ⏳ Validate patterns backwards
