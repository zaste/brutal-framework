# 🗺️ BRUTAL V5 - Roadmap

> ✅ **Distilled**: 2024-07-12
> - Iterative approach → [pattern](./foundation/patterns/governance/iterative-development.md)
> - Success metrics → [pattern](./foundation/patterns/quality/success-metrics.md)
> - Decision-driven progress → [pattern](./foundation/patterns/governance/decision-flow.md)

> This is a living roadmap following our [iterative development pattern](./foundation/patterns/governance/iterative-development.md). The path adapts as we learn.

## Current Focus

### 🎯 Immediate (This Week)
1. **Resolve 5 pending decisions** - [See pending decisions](./foundation/decisions/pending/)
2. **Create first package** - `@brutal/foundation` as proof of concept
3. **Setup monorepo tooling** - pnpm workspaces, build pipeline
4. **Implement test-extractor** - Enable co-located tests

### 📅 Next (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Core packages** - Implement the 11 core packages (35KB total)
2. **Security linting** - Create @brutal/eslint-plugin-security
3. **Cross-browser testing** - Setup Playwright matrix
4. **Migration scripts** - V4 → V5 code transformations

### 🔮 Future (Next Month)
1. **Enhanced packages** - Advanced versions of core
2. **UI primitives** - Component library
3. **Documentation site** - Interactive examples
4. **Community feedback** - Iterate based on usage

## Progress Tracking

### Foundation Health
- ✅ Architecture documented
- ✅ Quality standards defined
- ✅ Learning integrated from V3/V4
- ⏳ 5 decisions pending
- ❌ No code yet

### Implementation Status
- [ ] Monorepo setup
- [ ] First package created
- [ ] Build pipeline working
- [ ] Tests running
- [ ] CI/CD configured

## Success Metrics

We'll know we're on track when:
1. **Developer Experience**: Setup takes < 5 minutes
2. **Performance**: Core loads in < 50ms
3. **Quality**: 95% coverage across all packages
4. **Adoption**: Positive community feedback
5. **Maintenance**: Changes don't cascade

## How to Help

1. **Review pending decisions** - Your input shapes the framework
2. **Test early releases** - Real usage reveals real issues
3. **Share feedback** - What works? What doesn't?
4. **Contribute** - PRs welcome (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md))
