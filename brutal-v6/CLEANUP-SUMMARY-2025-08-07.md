# 🧹 V6 Documentation Cleanup Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-07  
**Purpose**: Align documentation with current reality

## 📋 Changes Made

### 1. Created New Documentation
- ✅ `OPERATIONAL-STATUS-2025-08-07.md` - Honest current state assessment
- ✅ `README.md` - Clear, truthful project overview  
- ✅ `ROADMAP.md` - Realistic timeline with options
- ✅ `package.json` - Accurate project metadata (v0.4.3, 43% complete)
- ✅ `COMPREHENSIVE-ANALYSIS-2025-08-07.md` - Deep analysis of current state

### 2. Archived Outdated Files
Moved to `/archive` directory:
- Daily tracking files (DAY-*.md, END-OF-*.md)
- Outdated status files (ALIGNMENT-STATUS.md)
- Old decision summaries

### 3. Key Findings
- **Only 43% complete** (3 of 7 packages implemented)
- **3.2KB used** of 8.5KB budget
- **Missing critical features**: routing, events, animations
- **Last activity**: July 15, 2025 (23 days ago)

### 4. Honest Assessment
The framework shows promise but needs realistic expectations:
- ✅ Clean, minimal API in implemented packages
- ✅ Size targets being met so far
- ❌ Can't claim "everything React does" without routing
- ❌ Timeline was overly optimistic

## 🎯 Recommended Next Steps

### Option A: Continue Development (Recommended)
1. Implement @brutal/router (critical for SPA claim)
2. Implement @brutal/events (critical for interactivity)
3. Realistic timeline: 2-4 weeks more work

### Option B: Pivot Scope
1. Acknowledge what won't match React
2. Focus on specific use cases
3. Ship as specialized framework

### Option C: Document & Pause
1. Document learnings
2. Open source current state
3. Let community continue

## 📊 Current Truth
- **What works**: Counter, TODO app, basic state management
- **What doesn't**: No routing, no SPA capability, no animations
- **Size achievement**: On track (3.2KB for 43% features)
- **Timeline**: Original 5-day sprint was unrealistic

## 💡 Lessons Learned
1. 8.5KB might be achievable but needs more time
2. "Everything React does" might need clarification
3. Quality of implemented packages is excellent
4. Documentation drift happens quickly
