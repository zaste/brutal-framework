└── [Redirect documents]   ↪️ Point to new locations
```

## Documents with Redirects

These documents now redirect to their new locations:
- `PENDING-DECISIONS.md` → `foundation/decisions/pending/`
- `PHASE-0-FOUNDATION.md` → `foundation/README.md`
- `LESSONS-LEARNED.md` → `foundation/learning/journey-v3-v4.md`
- `QUALITY-STANDARDS.md` → `foundation/standards/quality/`

## Clean Root

The root now contains only:
1. **Essential docs** - README, LICENSE, etc.
2. **Current architecture** - What we're building
3. **Roadmap** - Where we're going
4. **Bundle map** - Package composition
5. **Redirects** - For backwards compatibility

## What Changed

### Before: Phase-based
- Phase 0 documents
- Completed/pending mindset
- Linear progression

### After: Living foundation
- Continuous evolution
- Decisions flow through stages
- Learning feeds back to principles

## Next Steps

1. **Remove redirect documents** (after confirming all references updated)
2. **Create package structure** (once decisions made)
3. **Start implementation** (following roadmap)
