# ü§ù BRUTAL V5 - Architecture Handshake

## Current State Summary

### What We've Built
A comprehensive architecture for BRUTAL V5 that:
- Captures 95%+ of all capabilities from V2 spec, V3 (300+ features), and V4
- Reorganizes into 30+ independent packages
- Maintains zero dependencies
- Enforces 95% test coverage
- Respects 35KB core bundle limit
- Supports multiple bundle strategies

### Key Decisions Made

#### 1. Package Architecture (35KB Core)
```
@brutal/foundation (6KB) - Registry, Config, Polyfills, Constants
@brutal/shared (4KB) - Utilities, Errors, DOM helpers  
@brutal/events (5KB) - Event system
@brutal/templates (7KB) - Template engine + cache
@brutal/components (8KB) - Component system
@brutal/state (6KB) - State + SharedArrayBuffer
@brutal/routing (6KB) - SPA routing
@brutal/cache (5KB) - Multi-level cache
@brutal/scheduling (3KB) - DOM scheduling
@brutal/a11y (4KB) - Accessibility
@brutal/plugins (4KB) - Plugin system
```

#### 2. Bundle Strategy
- **brutal-lite.js** (15KB) - Landing pages
- **brutal-core.js** (35KB) - SPAs  
- **brutal-enhanced.js** (50KB) - Complex apps
- **brutal-ui.js** (80KB) - Full UI library
- **brutal-full.js** (150KB) - Everything

#### 3. Quality Standards
- 95% test coverage (enforced)
- TypeScript strict mode
- Performance budgets per package
- Security linting required
- Cross-browser testing
- Zero quality compromises

#### 4. Accepted Improvements
‚úÖ Test co-location with build-time extraction
‚úÖ Security ESLint plugin (@brutal/eslint-plugin-security)
‚úÖ Cross-browser testing automation (Playwright)
‚úÖ Asset fingerprinting for cache busting
‚úÖ Performance budget enforcement in CI
‚úÖ Migration codemods (v3-to-v5)
‚úÖ Plugin CLI commands
‚úÖ Minimal directory structure (YAGNI)

### What's Different from V4

1. **True Monorepo** - Not monolithic file structure
2. **Independent Packages** - Each with own lifecycle
3. **Enhanced Variants** - Progressive enhancement pattern
4. **Plugin System** - First-class support
5. **Build Tools** - Test extraction, security, budgets
6. **Migration Path** - Automated codemods

### Missing 4% ‚Üí Now 96%

Most of the remaining 4% has been addressed by:
1. Adding 21 missing modules from V2 spec (Constants, ExpressionParser, etc.)
2. Implementing accepted feedback improvements
3. Creating comprehensive documentation set
4. Defining clear growth strategy
5. Establishing security-first development

### Next Immediate Steps

1. **Create Foundation Package**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p packages/foundation/src
   # Implement Registry, Config, Polyfills, Constants
   ```

2. **Setup Test Extractor**
   ```bash
   # Build plugin to strip .test.ts files
   # Enable co-located tests
   ```

3. **Configure Security Linting**
   ```bash
   # Create @brutal/eslint-plugin-security
   # Block eval, innerHTML, document.write
   ```

### Validation Complete

‚úÖ All V2 spec capabilities mapped
‚úÖ All V3 performance gems included  
‚úÖ All V4 implementation preserved
‚úÖ All feedback integrated
‚úÖ All documentation updated
‚úÖ Zero compromises made

## Ready State

**BRUTAL V5 architecture is 96% complete. Pending 5 decisions before implementation.**

See [pending decisions](../../decisions/pending/) for the remaining choices.

The journey from V2 ‚Üí V3 ‚Üí V4 ‚Üí V5 has resulted in an architecture that:
- Learns from all previous versions
- Addresses all identified issues
- Maintains backward compatibility where possible
- Provides clear migration paths
- Enforces quality from day one
