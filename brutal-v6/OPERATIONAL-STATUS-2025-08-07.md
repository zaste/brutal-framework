# 📊 BRUTAL V6 - Operational Status Report
**Date**: 2025-08-07  
**Status**: In Development (43% Complete)

## 🎯 Mission Statement
Prove that 8.5KB can do EVERYTHING that matters from React's 300KB+

## 📈 Current Progress

### Package Implementation Status
| Package | Status | Size | Purpose | Complete |
|---------|--------|------|---------|----------|
| @brutal/core | ✅ Complete | 1.6KB | Composition foundation | 100% |
| @brutal/dom | ✅ Complete | 1.1KB | Template rendering | 100% |
| @brutal/state | ✅ Complete | 0.541KB | Global state | 100% |
| @brutal/events | ❌ Not Started | ~1KB | Event delegation | 0% |
| @brutal/router | ❌ Not Started | ~1KB | SPA routing | 0% |
| @brutal/animation | ❌ Not Started | ~1KB | GPU animations | 0% |
| @brutal/utils | ❌ Not Started | ~0.5KB | Shared helpers | 0% |

**Total Implemented**: 3.2KB of 8.5KB (37.6%)

### North Star Checkpoints
- ✅ **Checkpoint 1** (Hello World < 2KB): ACHIEVED
- ⚠️ **Checkpoint 2** (TODO App < 50 lines): PARTIAL (needs 3 packages)
- ❌ **Checkpoint 3** (Landing Page): BLOCKED (no router)

## 🚨 Critical Path Items

### Immediate Blockers
1. **No Routing** = Can't build SPAs (core claim)
2. **No Event System** = Limited interactivity
3. **No Animation** = Missing "fluidas animaciones" claim

### What Works Today
```javascript
// ✅ Counter (8 lines, 1.6KB)
import { compose, withState } from '@brutal/core';

const Counter = compose(
  withState({ count: 0 }),
  ({ count, setState }) => ({
    view: () => `<button>${count}</button>`,
    click: () => setState({ count: count + 1 })
  })
);
```

```javascript
// ✅ TODO App (35 lines, 3.2KB total)
// Works but requires all 3 implemented packages
```

## 📅 Realistic Timeline

### Option A: Minimum Viable V6 (2 weeks)
- Week 1: Implement @brutal/router + @brutal/events
- Week 2: Create SPA example, validate 8.5KB claim
- Defer: Animation, advanced utils

### Option B: Full Vision (4 weeks)
- Week 1-2: Router + Events
- Week 3: Animation system
- Week 4: Utils + complete examples

### Option C: Pivot Scope (1 week)
- Acknowledge what WON'T match React
- Focus on specific use cases
- Ship as "BRUTAL Lite" or similar

## 🔍 Honest Assessment

### Strengths
- Clean, minimal API
- Excellent size/functionality ratio (so far)
- Composition pattern works well

### Weaknesses
- 57% of packages unimplemented
- No proof yet of 8.5KB claim with full features
- Core SPA functionality missing

### Risks
- Remaining 5.3KB may not fit routing + animations + events
- API might become cryptic to save bytes
- "Everything React does" claim may be unrealistic

## 📋 Next Actions

### Priority 1: Decision Required
Choose timeline option (A, B, or C) before proceeding

### Priority 2: If Continuing
1. Implement @brutal/router (critical path)
2. Implement @brutal/events (critical path)
3. Build complete SPA example
4. Validate total bundle size

### Priority 3: Documentation
1. Archive outdated daily tracking files
2. Update all dates to current
3. Create honest README about what's built

## 💡 Recommendation

**Be honest about the current state**. The implemented packages are excellent, but claiming "everything React does" without routing is misleading. Either:

1. Extend timeline to implement properly
2. Reduce scope to what's achievable
3. Rebrand as specialized framework (not React replacement)

The 8.5KB goal is ambitious but possibly achievable with careful implementation. However, it requires focused effort on the remaining 57% of packages.
