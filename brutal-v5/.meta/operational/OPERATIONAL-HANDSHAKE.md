# BRUTAL V5 - OPERATIONAL HANDSHAKE

## Current State (2025-07-12)

### 🎯 CRITICAL UPDATE - DIRECTORY CLEANUP COMPLETED

All configuration files have been centralized and references updated. The directory structure is now 100% clean and aligned with BRUTAL V5 architecture.

### ✅ Completed
1. **Core Infrastructure**
   - 8 packages created and working (foundation, shared, events, components, state, templates, routing, cache)
   - TypeScript build system with tsup
   - Zero-dependency architecture enforced
   - Co-located tests (*.test.ts next to source)
   - Bundle system with 5 bundles configured

2. **Fixed Issues**
   - Size-limit configurations corrected
   - pnpm workspace cleaned
   - tsconfig references fixed
   - Test structure compliant

### ✅ Directory Cleanup - COMPLETED

All files have been moved to their proper locations:
- Documentation moved to `/foundation`
- Configs centralized in `/config`
- Package duplicates removed
- Empty directories cleaned

Current clean structure:
```
/brutal-v5/
├── packages/@brutal/    # 8 working packages
├── config/             # All configs centralized
├── dist/bundles/       # Bundle outputs
├── tests/              # Integration tests
├── foundation/         # All documentation
├── scripts/            # Build scripts
├── tools/              # Development tools
└── bundles/            # Bundle sources
```

### ✅ Reference Updates - COMPLETED

All references have been updated:
- package.json now points to `config/rollup.config.js`
- All packages have `.eslintrc.js` pointing to central config
- All packages have `jest.config.js` pointing to central config
- Root has proxy configs pointing to `/config`

### 🎯 Next Steps After Cleanup
1. Create remaining 20 packages
2. Complete bundle system integration
3. Set up performance benchmarks
4. Implement visual testing

### 🔧 Critical Commands
```bash
# Build all packages
npm run build

# Validate structure
npm run validate:all

# Create new package
npm run create:package <name>

# Test bundles
npm run build:bundles
```

### ⚠️ Important Notes
- All packages must have zero external dependencies
- Tests must be co-located (src/*.test.ts)
- Maintain perfect package structure
- Config files are centralized in /config
- Documentation lives in /foundation

### 📦 Package Creation Template
When creating new packages, they must follow:
- Zero dependencies (except other @brutal packages)
- Co-located tests
- Perfect structure validation
- Size limits enforced

## Recovery Instructions
If context window is lost:
1. Read this file first
2. Check current directory structure with `tree -L 2`
3. Run `npm run validate:all` to see current state
4. Continue with pending cleanup tasks
5. Then proceed with package creation
