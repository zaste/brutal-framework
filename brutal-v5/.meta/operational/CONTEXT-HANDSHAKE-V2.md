# 🤝 BRUTAL V5 - Context Handshake V2

## Session Summary (2024-07-12)

### What We Accomplished
1. **Extracted 44 patterns** from V5 sources (increased from 35)
2. **Created comprehensive V5 implementation guides**:
   - V5 Core Implementation Guide
   - Implementation Roadmap (14-week plan)
   - Package Structure Template
   - Quality Standards
   - Dependency Graph
3. **Filled ALL pattern categories** (11/11 at 100%)
4. **Updated foundation README** as main knowledge index

```

### Key Insights Distilled
1. **Zero dependencies** - No runtime deps ever
2. **Modular monorepo** - True package independence
3. **Start simple, grow smart** - YAGNI for structure
4. **Automation over discipline** - Quality enforced by tools
5. **Explicit over implicit** - No magic behavior

### Implementation Order (Critical)
```
Phase 0: Foundation Setup (Current)
Phase 1: Core Packages (11 packages in dependency order)
Phase 2: Enhanced Packages (3 packages)
Phase 3: UI & Extensions (12 packages)
Phase 4: Tools & Documentation
```

### Success Criteria Established
- Zero "figure it out later"
- Zero undocumented decisions
- Zero quality compromises
- Zero dependency creep
- Zero architecture drift

## If Context Switches

### Continue From Here
1. **Check foundation/README.md** - Main index to all knowledge
2. **Follow IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP.md** - Current phase and next steps
3. **Use PACKAGE-STRUCTURE-TEMPLATE.md** - For creating packages
4. **Enforce QUALITY-STANDARDS.md** - Non-negotiable requirements

### Current Phase: Phase 0 - Foundation Setup
- Monorepo tooling setup
- First package: @brutal/foundation
- Automation scripts
- CI/CD pipeline

### Next Major Tasks
1. Complete foundation package implementation
2. Create package creation script
3. Setup quality gates
4. Begin Phase 1 core packages

### Important Files to Review
- `/foundation/V5-CORE-IMPLEMENTATION-GUIDE.md` - Complete blueprint
- `/foundation/architecture/DEPENDENCY-GRAPH.md` - Build order
- `/foundation/patterns/` - All 44 patterns
- `/foundation/decisions/pending/` - Decisions needed

## Key Principles (Never Forget)
1. **No runtime dependencies**
2. **95% test coverage minimum**
3. **35KB core bundle maximum**
4. **Every package same structure**
5. **Quality automated, not manual**

## Archive Status
- V5 root: ✅ Fully distilled
- foundation/archive: ⏳ Pending extraction
- V4 code: ⏳ Pending pattern extraction
- V3 code: ⏳ Pending gem extraction
