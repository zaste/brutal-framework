# 🧪 Test Status Report - January 12, 2025

## ✅ Major Progress

### Jest ESM Configuration Fixed
- Renamed `jest.preset.js` → `jest.preset.mjs`
- Updated all `jest.config.js` → `jest.config.mjs`
- Added `NODE_OPTIONS='--experimental-vm-modules'` to all test scripts
- All packages can now run tests with ES modules

### TypeScript Errors Fixed
- Fixed unused variables in `@brutal/shared/sanitizer.ts`
- All packages now pass `pnpm type-check`

### Test Execution Status
- **@brutal/foundation**: ✅ 11 test suites, 35 tests passing
- **@brutal/shared**: ✅ 14 test suites, 42 tests passing
- Module resolution errors: **FIXED**

## 🔴 Coverage Issues

### Current Coverage (Below 95% Target)
```
Statements: 94.11% (Target: 95%) ❌
Branches:   62.5%  (Target: 95%) ❌
Functions:  100%   (Target: 95%) ✅
Lines:      93.93% (Target: 95%) ❌
```

### Coverage Gaps
- Branch coverage significantly low (62.5%)
- Need to add tests for:
  - Error conditions
  - Edge cases
  - Alternative code paths

⚠️ = Not yet tested individually

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate (P0)
1. Test remaining 9 packages individually
2. Fix any failing tests
3. Add tests to reach 95% coverage
4. Ensure all packages meet coverage thresholds

### Secondary (P1)
1. Configure size-limit for all packages
2. Update deprecated dependencies
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline

### Future (P2)
1. Create remaining 17 packages
2. Implement actual features
3. Enhanced functionality

## 💡 Key Achievements

1. **Jest ESM Working** - Major blocker resolved
2. **TypeScript Clean** - No more compilation errors
3. **Tests Running** - Can now measure and improve coverage
4. **Foundation Solid** - Build system fully operational

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- DO NOT proceed with new features until 95% coverage
- Each package must be tested individually
- Coverage must include edge cases and error paths
- All warnings must be addressed

## 📈 Progress Metrics
