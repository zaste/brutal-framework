# 🧬 BRUTAL V5 - Knowledge Distillation Plan

## The Challenge

We have valuable knowledge scattered across:
- V3: 300+ capabilities in monolithic structure
- V4: Clean architecture, 100% complete core
- brutal-test: Testing patterns and strategies
- V5 docs: Architecture decisions and learnings

## Distillation Strategy

### Option A: Distill First, Build Later
**Process**: Extract all knowledge → Organize → Then implement

**Pros**:
- Complete understanding before coding
- No missed patterns
- Clear implementation guide

**Cons**:
- Delays implementation
- Analysis paralysis risk
- Some patterns only emerge during coding

### Option B: Distill While Building
**Process**: Build foundation → Distill as needed → Integrate learnings

**Pros**:
- Immediate progress
- Practical knowledge extraction
- Real validation of patterns

**Cons**:
- Might miss some patterns
- Requires discipline to capture learnings
- Potential rework

### Option C: Hybrid Approach ✨
**Process**: Distill critical knowledge → Build core → Distill more → Build more

## Recommended: Hybrid Approach

### Phase 1: Critical Knowledge Extraction (This Week)

#### 1. Core Patterns (From V4)
```
Source: brutal-v4/core/
Distill into: foundation/patterns/core/
- Component lifecycle
- State management patterns  
- Event system patterns
- Template compilation
```

#### 2. Performance Gems (From V3)
```
Source: framework-v3/02-performance/
Distill into: foundation/patterns/performance/
- StyleManager strategies
- FragmentPool patterns
- DOMScheduler algorithms
- EventManager optimizations
```

#### 3. Architecture Decisions (From All)
```
Source: All versions
Distill into: foundation/decisions/accepted/
- Why zero dependencies
- Why modular architecture
- Why 95% coverage
- Bundle strategy rationale
```

### Phase 2: Build Foundation Package
With critical knowledge distilled, implement:
- `packages/foundation/`
- Using distilled patterns
- Capturing new learnings

### Phase 3: Progressive Distillation
As we build each package:
1. Extract relevant patterns from V3/V4
2. Document in `foundation/patterns/`
3. Implement with improvements
4. Update learnings

## Knowledge Categories to Distill

### 1. 🏗️ Architecture Patterns
- Module boundaries
- Dependency management
- Plugin architecture
- Bundle composition

### 2. 🎯 Core Patterns
- Component creation
- Lifecycle management
- State synchronization
- Event propagation

### 3. ⚡ Performance Patterns
- Memory management
- DOM optimization
- Render scheduling
- Cache strategies

### 4. 🧪 Testing Patterns
- Component testing
- Visual regression
- Performance testing
- Integration testing

### 5. 🔧 Build Patterns
- Tree shaking
- Code splitting
- Minification
- Source maps

### 6. 📚 API Patterns
- Naming conventions
- Parameter design
- Error handling
- Extensibility

## Distillation Process

### For Each Pattern:
1. **Identify** - Where is it implemented?
2. **Extract** - What's the core insight?
3. **Refine** - How can we improve it?
4. **Document** - Capture in foundation/patterns/
5. **Implement** - Apply in V5 with improvements

### Example: StyleManager Pattern

```markdown
# Pattern: Style Deduplication

## Source
V3: framework-v3/02-performance/01-StyleManager.js

## Problem
Duplicate style rules bloat the DOM and slow rendering.

## Solution
1. Hash style content
2. Check cache before insertion
3. Reference count for cleanup
4. Atomic style updates

## V5 Implementation
Location: @brutal/performance/style-deduper
Improvements:
- Use WeakMap for auto-cleanup
- Batch style updates
- CSS custom properties for theming

## Code Example
[Clean implementation example]
```

## Tooling for Distillation

### 1. Pattern Extractor Script
```javascript
// scripts/extract-patterns.js
// Scans V3/V4 for patterns
// Generates pattern templates
// Links to source code
```

### 2. Knowledge Graph
```
foundation/patterns/
├── INDEX.md          # Pattern map
├── core/            # Core patterns
├── performance/     # Performance patterns
├── testing/         # Testing patterns
└── api/            # API design patterns
```

## Decision Point

**Question**: Should we:
1. Spend 1 week on full distillation first?
2. Distill just foundation patterns and start building?
3. Build first package and distill as we go?

**My Recommendation**: Option 2 - Distill foundation patterns (2-3 days), then start building while progressively distilling more.

## Next Steps

1. **Create pattern structure** in foundation/patterns/
2. **Extract 5-10 critical patterns** from V4 core
3. **Document performance gems** from V3
4. **Start foundation package** with distilled knowledge
5. **Continue distillation** as we build
