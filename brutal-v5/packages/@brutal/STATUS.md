# ðŸ“š LEGACY REFERENCE - @brutal

**DO NOT MODIFY** - These packages are for reference only.

## Purpose
- Learn from existing implementations
- Extract patterns (especially minimal.ts files)
- Understand what worked and what didn't

## Best Examples to Study
- `animation/src/minimal.ts` - Clean animation API
- `validation/src/minimal.ts` - Schema validation  
- `testing/src/minimal.ts` - Test runner
- `templates/src/minimal.ts` - Template compilation

## Active Development
All new work happens in `packages/@brutal2/`

## Why Keep These?
1. Reference for feature parity
2. Learn from minimal implementations
3. Migration compatibility
4. Historical context
