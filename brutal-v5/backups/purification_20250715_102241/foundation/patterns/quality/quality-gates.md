# Quality Gates Pattern

## Problem
Manual quality enforcement leads to inconsistent code quality, technical debt accumulation, and eventual project degradation.

## Solution
Automated quality gates that enforce standards at every stage of development, making it impossible to merge code that doesn't meet criteria.

### Implementation
```yaml
# Quality gate configuration
quality_gates:
  pre_commit:
    - lint: strict
    - format: prettier
    - types: 100%
    
  pre_push:
    - tests: pass
    - coverage: 95%+
    - security: scan
    
  pre_merge:
    - performance: <50ms init
    - size: within budget
    - dependencies: zero
    - documentation: complete
```

### Multi-Stage Enforcement
1. **Local Development**: Pre-commit hooks
2. **Push Protection**: Pre-push validation
3. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Full validation suite
4. **Merge Protection**: All gates must pass

### Success Metrics
- Zero "figure it out later"
- Zero undocumented decisions
- Zero quality compromises
- Zero dependency creep
- Zero architecture drift

## Evolution
- V3: Quality issues discovered late
- V4: Some automation, incomplete
- V5: Full automation, no exceptions

## Trade-offs
- ✅ Consistent quality guaranteed
- ✅ Technical debt prevented
- ✅ Team scalability enabled
- ❌ Initial setup complexity
- ❌ Occasional false positives
