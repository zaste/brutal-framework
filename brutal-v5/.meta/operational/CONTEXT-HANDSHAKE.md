# 🤝 BRUTAL V5 - Context Handshake

## Current State (2024-07-12)

### What We're Doing
Extracting critical patterns from V3/V4/V5 to build the BRUTAL V5 foundation. Working backwards from most refined (V5) to oldest (V3), then validating in reverse.

### Extraction Progress

#### ✅ V5 Extraction Complete (8 patterns)
- Architecture and bundle patterns extracted
- Quality and governance patterns documented
- Core principles established
- Root cleaned and references fixed

#### ✅ V4 Extraction Progress (4 patterns)
- Component lifecycle with WeakMaps
- Proxy-based state management  
- Event system with auto-cleanup
- Template compilation with caching

#### 🔄 V3 Extraction In Progress (4 patterns done)
- DOM scheduling with requestIdleCallback
- Fragment pooling for performance
- Layout optimization (containment/will-change)
- GPU-accelerated animation system

### Pattern Count: 16 Total
- V5: 8 patterns (architecture/principles)
- V4: 4 patterns (core implementations)
- V3: 4 patterns (performance optimizations)
- Remaining: ~16 patterns

### Currently Extracting From V3
Despite syntax errors in V3 files, extracting core concepts:
- ✅ DOMScheduler - Batch DOM operations
- ✅ FragmentPool - Reusable fragments
- ✅ LayoutOptimizer - CSS containment
- ✅ AnimationSystem - Spring physics

### Next V3 Patterns to Extract
- [ ] EventManager (advanced delegation)
- [ ] StyleManager (deduplication)
- [ ] MemoryManager (leak prevention)
- [ ] GPU patterns (WebGL/compute)

### Still Need From V4
- [ ] Plugin architecture
- [ ] Render scheduling
- [ ] Build system patterns

### From brutal-test
- [ ] Tests as components
- [ ] Visual regression
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Symbiotic testing

### Key Pending Decisions
1. SSR Support Location
2. Telemetry Implementation  
3. Error Package Structure
4. SharedArrayBuffer Support
5. Template Cache Strategy

### Working Method
1. Read source file (even with syntax errors)
2. Extract core concepts and patterns
3. Create clean pattern document
4. Update extraction log
5. Continue systematically

### Context Window: ~15% remaining
Continue extracting V3 performance patterns before validation phase.
