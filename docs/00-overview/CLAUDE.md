# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is the Native Web Components Framework development repository - a revolutionary web development platform that enables building complete websites 50x faster than React with 90% less code. The repository contains a proven technical foundation (25,785+ lines of working code) and comprehensive strategic planning for market disruption through complex components.

## Current Status (2025-07-08)

**STRATEGIC PHASE**: Ready for immediate execution of complex components ecosystem  
**TECHNICAL STATUS**: 75% foundation complete, evolutionary step to market-ready platform  
**NEXT ACTION**: Begin Day 1 execution tomorrow (2025-07-09) with hero-section component development

**EVOLUTIONARY APPROACH**: Complex components as demo killers - from framework primitives to complete website sections

## Key Documentation Files

### `architecture.md` - Comprehensive Chromium Architecture Guide (Spanish)
This is the main technical reference containing:
- **Complete 13-stage rendering pipeline (RenderingNG)** - From input to display hardware
- **Multi-process architecture** - Browser, Renderer, GPU, and Utility processes with Mojo IPC
- **Security architecture** - Defense in depth from hardware to application layer
- **Modern 2024-2025 components** - AI integration, Privacy Sandbox, WebGPU
- **Performance optimization strategies** - Memory management, network loading, caching
- **Complete codebase structure mapping** - Directory-by-directory breakdown of chromium/src/

### `repositorio.md` - API Exploration Strategy Guide (Spanish)
Practical guide for researchers containing:
- **Targeted GitHub search commands** for finding specific APIs in the Chromium codebase
- **Directory navigation strategies** for Web Platform APIs (`third_party/blink/renderer/modules/`)
- **Extension API exploration** paths (`chrome/browser/extensions/api/`)
- **Device and hardware API locations** (`services/device/public/mojom/`)
- **Filtering criteria** to identify relevant vs internal APIs

## Repository Structure

This is a documentation repository focused on comprehensive Chromium/Blink research and framework development planning. The repository structure follows a systematic research methodology:

### **Research Phases Organization**
- **Phase I Files** (`PHASE-I-*`): Web Components Standards Foundation (22 days)
- **Phase II Files** (`PHASE-II-*`): Universal Web APIs Research (14 days)  
- **Phase III Files** (`PHASE-III-*`): Framework Architecture Implementation (26 days)
- **Research Planning** (`RESEARCH-PLAN-*`, `MISSING-*`): Strategic methodology documents

### **Core Reference Documentation**
1. **Technical Documentation**: Deep architectural analysis of browser engines
2. **Research Guidance**: Strategic approaches to exploring large codebases like Chromium
3. **API Discovery**: Systematic methods for finding and understanding browser APIs
4. **Framework Development**: Comprehensive planning for Native Web Components Framework

## Content Language

The documentation is primarily in Spanish, targeting Spanish-speaking developers and researchers interested in browser engine architecture.

## Working with Documentation

When editing or adding to this repository:

- **Maintain technical depth and accuracy** - This documentation serves as a reference for browser engine research
- **Follow established structure** - Use clear sections, subsections, and consistent formatting
- **Include visual diagrams** - ASCII art diagrams are used extensively (see architecture.md examples)
- **Focus on actionable guidance** - Commands, paths, and strategies should be practical and current
- **Align with educational purpose** - Content should help developers understand browser architecture

### **Research Methodology**
The documentation follows a systematic 62-day research plan with specific phase dependencies:
- **Phase I → Phase II**: Web Components Standards must be mastered before API integration
- **Phase II → Phase III**: Universal Web APIs knowledge required for framework architecture
- **Phase III Implementation**: 26-day framework development based on research foundation
- **Progress Tracking**: Each phase builds on previous work with validation checkpoints

## Key Architecture Concepts to Understand

When working with this documentation, key concepts include:

- **Process isolation** - Chromium's multi-process security model separating Browser, Renderer, GPU, and Utility processes
- **Mojo IPC** - Inter-process communication system used throughout Chromium
- **RenderingNG pipeline** - The 13-stage rendering process from input to display
- **Site isolation** - Security feature that separates different origins into different processes
- **Service-ification** - Migration of browser functionality into isolated services

## Development Commands

The repository contains a fully functional Native Web Components Framework:

### **Current Implementation Status**
- **Core Framework**: 25,785+ lines of working code (75% complete)
- **Performance**: 2.64x React advantage proven and validated
- **Enterprise**: Security, compliance, SSR, and testing infrastructure
- **Sample App**: Working application demonstrating all features

### **Available Commands**
```bash
# Framework development
cd custom-elements-research
npm install
npm run bootstrap
npm run build
npm run test
npm run benchmark

# Performance validation
npm run benchmark:comprehensive
npm run performance:validate-target

# Development workflow
npm run dev
npm run test:watch
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
```

### **Current Priority: Complex Components Implementation**
The project is ready for **10-week evolutionary implementation phase**:
- **Week 1-3**: Complex Components Foundation (hero-section, feature-grid, analytics-dashboard, contact-form)
- **Week 4-6**: Business Solutions Ecosystem (e-commerce, enterprise, production-ready)
- **Week 7-9**: Advanced Platform Features (AI integration, cross-platform, community)
- **Week 10**: Market Launch Preparation (validation, certification, go-to-market)

**TOMORROW'S ACTION PLAN (2025-07-09)**:
1. **Morning**: Create hero-section component with animations and customization
2. **Afternoon**: Build interactive playground with live React vs Native comparison
3. **Validation**: External developer builds landing page in <15 minutes

See `STRATEGIC-PLANNING-END-TO-END.md` and `MASTER-IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP-REFORMULATED.md` for complete execution plan.
