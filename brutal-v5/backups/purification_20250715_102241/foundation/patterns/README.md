# ðŸ“š Pattern Library Overview

## Current Status

We're distilling knowledge from V3/V4 into reusable patterns. This is an ongoing process that happens alongside development.

### Patterns Captured
- âœ… [Component Lifecycle](./core/component-lifecycle.md) - How components initialize and clean up
- âœ… [Style Deduplication](./performance/style-deduplication.md) - Share styles across instances

### Patterns to Extract

#### From V4 (High Priority)
- [ ] State Management - Reactive proxy-based state
- [ ] Event System - Unified event handling
- [ ] Template Compilation - HTML template processing
- [ ] Module Organization - Clean dependency management
- [ ] Error Boundaries - Component error handling

#### From V3 (Performance Gems)
- [ ] Fragment Pool - DOM node reuse
- [ ] DOM Scheduler - Frame-aware updates
- [ ] Event Manager - Delegation and optimization
- [ ] Memory Safety - WeakMap patterns

#### From brutal-test
- [ ] Test as Components - Symbiotic testing
- [ ] Visual Regression - Screenshot comparison
- [ ] Performance Testing - Metric collection

## Distillation Process

1. **Identify** - Find pattern in V3/V4
2. **Extract** - Understand core concept
3. **Refine** - Improve for V5
4. **Document** - Create pattern file
5. **Apply** - Use in implementation

## How to Contribute
