# Decision: Knowledge Distillation Approach

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-07-12

## Context

We have valuable patterns and knowledge scattered across:
- V3: 300+ capabilities in monolithic structure
- V4: Clean architecture with complete core implementation
- brutal-test: Innovative testing approaches
- Community feedback and learnings

We need a systematic way to capture and apply this knowledge in V5.

## Decision

Use a **Hybrid Progressive Distillation** approach:

1. **Extract critical patterns first** (2-3 days)
   - Component lifecycle
   - State management
   - Core architecture patterns

2. **Build while distilling** 
   - Start with foundation package
   - Extract patterns as needed for each package
   - Document patterns as we implement

3. **Continuous learning**
   - Capture new insights during development
   - Update patterns based on real usage
   - Feed learnings back to principles

## Implementation

Created `foundation/patterns/` structure:
```
patterns/
├── core/          # Fundamental patterns
├── performance/   # Optimization patterns
├── testing/       # Quality patterns
├── api/          # Design patterns
└── build/        # Compilation patterns
```

Each pattern follows standard template with:
- Problem statement
- Context for use
- Solution with code
- Trade-offs
- Evolution from V3/V4

## Consequences

✅ **Benefits**:
- Preserves valuable knowledge
- Enables immediate progress
- Learning guides implementation
- Knowledge compounds over time

⚠️ **Considerations**:
- Requires discipline to document
- Some patterns only emerge during coding
- Must balance documentation with progress
