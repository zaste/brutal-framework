# Pattern: Iterative Development Strategy

## Problem
Traditional roadmaps create rigid expectations:
- Fixed milestones limit flexibility
- Linear progression ignores learning
- "Next Phase" thinking delays value
- Success becomes binary (done/not done)

## Solution
Adopt iterative development with continuous value delivery and learning integration.

## Implementation

### Focus-Based Planning
```markdown
# Instead of:
Phase 1: Foundation (Q1)
Phase 2: Core (Q2)
Phase 3: Enhanced (Q3)

# Use:
🎯 Immediate Focus (This Week)
📅 Next Iteration (Next 2 Weeks)
🔮 Future Considerations (Next Month)
```

### Success Through Metrics, Not Milestones
```javascript
// Traditional: Milestone-based
const milestones = {
  'Q1': 'Foundation Complete',
  'Q2': 'Core Packages Done',
  'Q3': 'Launch Ready'
};

// Iterative: Metric-based
const successMetrics = {
  developerExperience: 'Setup < 5 minutes',
  performance: 'Core loads < 50ms',
  quality: '95% coverage maintained',
  adoption: 'Positive feedback ratio > 90%',
  maintenance: 'Change isolation verified'
};
```

### Living Roadmap Structure
```markdown
## Current Focus
What we're actively working on now

## Next Iteration  
What we'll tackle next based on current learning

## Future Considerations
Ideas that may change based on discoveries

## Progress Tracking
Observable metrics, not percentage complete

## How to Help
Specific, actionable ways to contribute now
```

## Progress Tracking Methods

### Health Indicators Over Percentages
```markdown
❌ Bad: "Foundation 80% complete"

✅ Good: 
### Foundation Health
- ✅ Architecture documented
- ✅ Quality standards defined
- ✅ Learning integrated from V3/V4
- ⏳ 5 decisions pending
- ❌ No code yet
```

### Observable Status
```markdown
### Implementation Status
- [ ] Monorepo setup
- [ ] First package created
- [ ] Build pipeline working
- [ ] Tests running
- [ ] CI/CD configured

Clear, binary, observable states
```

## Decision-Driven Progress

### Decisions Unblock Work
```javascript
// Each decision enables specific work
const decisions = {
  'SSR Support': {
    blocking: ['@brutal/rendering', '@brutal/hydration'],
    impact: 'Architecture of rendering pipeline'
  },
  'Template Cache': {
    blocking: ['@brutal/templates optimization'],
    impact: 'Memory vs performance trade-off'
  }
};

// Work proceeds in parallel where possible
```

### Continuous Decision Making
```markdown
# Not "wait for all decisions"
while (pendingDecisions.length > 0) {
  const decision = getNextDecision();
  const result = makeDecision(decision);
  updatePatterns(result);
  enableNewWork(result);
}
```

## Learning Integration

### Feedback Loops
```javascript
class IterativeDevelopment {
  async iterate() {
    const work = this.getCurrentFocus();
    const results = await this.implement(work);
    const learnings = this.extractLearnings(results);
    
    // Learning immediately affects next iteration
    this.updatePatterns(learnings);
    this.adjustNextIteration(learnings);
    this.shareWithCommunity(learnings);
  }
}
```

### Roadmap Updates
```markdown
# Weekly roadmap review
1. What did we learn this week?
2. How does that change our next iteration?
3. What new opportunities emerged?
4. What assumptions were wrong?

# Document changes
> 📝 Roadmap Update: 2024-07-12
> - Learned: Test extraction harder than expected
> - Change: Prioritizing simpler build setup first
> - New: Community suggested CDN priority
```

## Benefits of Iterative Approach

### Flexibility
- Adapt to discoveries
- Incorporate feedback quickly
- Pivot without "failure"
- Natural priority emergence

### Continuous Value
- Something useful every week
- No "big bang" delivery
- Early feedback opportunity
- Reduced risk

### Team Morale
- Regular wins
- Clear progress
- Learning celebrated
- No death marches

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### The Grand Plan
```markdown
❌ "Complete roadmap for next 12 months"
- Can't predict discoveries
- Locks in bad assumptions
- Discourages learning
```

### Phase Gates
```markdown
❌ "Can't start X until Y is 100% done"
- Artificial dependencies
- Wasted parallelism
- Delayed value
```

### Percentage Completion
```markdown
❌ "Project is 73% complete"
- Meaningless precision
- Implies linear progress
- Hides actual state
```

## Implementation Examples

### This Week's Focus
```markdown
### 🎯 Immediate (This Week)
1. **Resolve 5 pending decisions** 
   - Each unblocks specific work
   - Community input welcome
   
2. **Create first package**
   - @brutal/foundation as proof
   - Validates tooling choices
   
3. **Setup monorepo tooling**
   - Enables parallel development
   - Tests our architecture
```

### Adjusting Based on Learning
```javascript
// Original plan
const week1Plan = ['decisions', 'foundation', 'monorepo'];

// Thursday discovery
const discovery = 'pnpm workspaces have issues with our structure';

// Adjusted plan
const adjustedPlan = [
  'decisions',
  'investigate-rush', // New
  'foundation',
  'monorepo-with-rush' // Modified
];
```

## Success Metrics for Iteration

### Weekly
- Decisions made: > 0
- Patterns extracted: > 2  
- Code shipped: Anything > nothing
- Feedback incorporated: Yes/No

### Monthly
- Developer satisfaction: > 90%
- Performance targets: Met/Not Met
- Quality gates: Passing/Failing
- Community growth: Positive trend

## Cultural Implications

### Language Changes
From: "When will it be done?"
To: "What are we learning?"

From: "We're behind schedule"
To: "We discovered something important"

From: "Follow the plan"
To: "Adapt to reality"
