## 🔍 **STRATEGIC ANALYSIS: BEFORE vs DURING PHASE III**

### **CRITICAL QUESTION ANSWERED**
```
❓ Should we implement missing capabilities:
   A) BEFORE Phase III (infrastructure-first approach)
   B) DURING Phase III (integrated approach)

✅ OPTIMAL ANSWER: HYBRID APPROACH
   - Critical infrastructure: BEFORE Phase III
   - Advanced capabilities: DURING Phase III  
   - Architecture integration: Phase III focus
```

### **PHASE III ORIGINAL PURPOSE**
```
📋 Phase III: Framework Architecture & Prototyping (Days 71-80)
├── Core framework architecture definition
├── Component lifecycle management
├── State management integration  
├── Routing solution design
├── Build system architecture
├── Plugin system design
