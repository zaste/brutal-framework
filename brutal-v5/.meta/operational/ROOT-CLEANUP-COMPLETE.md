- 📁 STRUCTURE-CHECKLIST.md → `foundation/standards/structure/`
- 📁 MASTER-VALIDATION.md → `foundation/standards/quality/`

### 3. Archived for Reference (4 files)
- 🗄️ BUNDLE-MAP.md → `foundation/archive/reference/`
- 🗄️ DIRECTORY-FINAL.md → `foundation/archive/reference/`
- 🗄️ KNOWLEDGE-DISTILLATION-PLAN.md → `foundation/archive/analysis/`
- 🗄️ STRUCTURE-SUMMARY.md → `foundation/archive/analysis/`

## Result

### Clean Root Philosophy
- **Operational documents only** - What people need day-to-day
- **Entry points visible** - README, ARCHITECTURE, ROADMAP
- **Requirements clear** - LICENSE, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT
- **Knowledge organized** - Everything else in foundation/

### Navigation Improved
```
Want to...
- Understand the project? → README.md
- See the architecture? → ARCHITECTURE.md  
- Know what's next? → ROADMAP.md
- Dive deeper? → foundation/
```

## Benefits

1. **First impression** - Clean, professional root
2. **Clear hierarchy** - Operational vs reference
3. **Easy navigation** - Find what you need
4. **No clutter** - Archived but accessible
